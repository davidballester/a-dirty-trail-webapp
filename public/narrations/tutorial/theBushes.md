{{playerName}} tried to make her way through thicket. The deeper she went, the darker it got.

The sound of the stream faded away and her arms and legs were now deeply scratched.

She got to a tree. It had no leaves and its branches were all twisted. From one of the lower ones, hung a necklace. {{playerName}} held it in her hand, feeling distressed, yet drawn to it. The idea of wearing it around her neck felt wrong, but she could not leave it behind, so she tied it around her wrist.

Thirstier than ever, she found her way back to the road.
