There was a pond on a clearing. As the rest of the woods, the water in it was dark. "Tainted," {{playerName}} muttered to herself.

She was too thirsty for these considerations, though. She knelt, washed her hands in the muddy water and drank as much as she dared.

Among the trees, she felt, several pairs of eyes oberved her. She had never felt so alone before.
