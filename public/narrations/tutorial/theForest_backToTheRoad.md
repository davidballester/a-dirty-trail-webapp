"Oh, dear, it's you!" Lady Willsbourgh opened her arms and {{playerName}} let herself be hugged. It'd never occured to her that there would come a time when seeing Lady Willsbourgh would actually be joyful.

"Did you find a way across this thing?" asked the minister.

"Nope." she said. "It's dark there, yo."

"Well, you better hurry up," he said, and pointed to the sky.

"Why? Is God going to strike me with thunder if I don't?"

"Nah, we'll just freeze to death out here, I guess," said the minister, and chuckled.

"Come on, {{playerName}}," Lady Willsbourgh said, holding her by her shoulders as if she was trying to prevent her from falling off. "You can do it."

Back in the day, there weren't as many coaches as there are now, or motivational videos on the Internet, so that simple speech was enough. Kind of.
