There they both were. The blockade in front of her and, underneath it, the crevice. She couldn't get to the blockade, because there were thorny bushes in the middle and she was not a fan of acupuncture.

"I can't get back to them just with this. I have to make sure we can get through."

Not far from there, there was a perfect place to get into the crevice.
