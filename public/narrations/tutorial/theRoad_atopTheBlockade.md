{{playerName}} had never been one of those that climb trees for fun, yet her fingers found the spaces between the logs, and her feet pushed her up. Before she knew how, she had reached the top, and she sat down there, feeling that standing up would only make her fall, thus ruining that small victory.

"What can you see, dear?" Lady Willsbourgh asked.

That was a good question, for there was not much to see.

"Just the road ahead," she said.

"Is that it?" the minister asked. {{#if-has-flag "demonsInTheWoods"}}"No evil demons on the other side?"{{/if-has-flag}}

"Nothing at all," she grunted.

"Well, then we need to get to the other side," the minister said.

"Not climbing that thing, surely!" Lady Willsbourgh said.

"By no means I'd ask such a thing from a Lady such as you!" the minister said, and chuckled. "You could lose a glove!"

"We'll have to find a way around it," {{playerName}} said. "But there is none that I can see."

She climbed back down.

"I'll look for one."
