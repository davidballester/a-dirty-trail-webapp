{{playerName}} untied **the necklace** from around her wrist. The old lady put her right hand forward, and {{playerName}} gave her the necklace.

"You've made an old woman happy," she said with a broad smile. Her teeth, bare, made {{playerName}} think of a coyote.

"Will you leave now?", {{playerName}} asked.

"I'll stay a little longer. You should go, though. It'll be **nightfall** soon."

{{playerName}} nodded head and continued walking, but before she was out of sight, the old lady called her.

"I'll tell you this: there is a girl in the inn. Nothing she ever says is true."

{{playerName}} observed the old lady. From this distance, she looked as if part of the shrine's rubble. She didn't respond.
