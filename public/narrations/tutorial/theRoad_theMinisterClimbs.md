The minister rolled up his sleeves.

"Watch and learn," he said as he started to climp up.

"Oh, stop it, minister," Lady Willsbourgh said. "You'll break your neck."

For some reason, {{playerName}} thought that a giant beaver snatching him from the top of the blockade was a more likely scenario. But the minister didn't get that far.

He lost footing and fell. He was lucky, for he had gone up no more than a couple feet, so the only thing hurt was his pride. But what a sore pride he got from that fall.

"So there is no going above it," {{playerName}} said. "I'll see if we can go around it."
