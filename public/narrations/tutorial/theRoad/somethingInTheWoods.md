Right there, among the thicket, there was a shadow. Or a bunch of them. They moved slowly through the trees, in the same direction as they were traveling.

{{playerName}} was not one to believe in the occult easily. She once had spoken with her dead aunt using a ouija board on a spiritist living room, but nothing else. So those were surely not demons of the forests.

"That's nonsense!" she said to herself, and laughed, and when she did, one of the shadows stopped advancing and seemed to look at her, so she screamed to the top of her lungs and ran to meet the others.

"Oh, dear, you almost gave me a heart attack!" said Lady Willsbourgh.

"What did you see in the woods?" the minister asked with a mysterious voice.

"Shadows!" {{playerName}} said. "Demons!"

Lady Willsbourgh covered her mouth, and she looked about to faint, when the minister laughed.

"Oh, my dear {{playerName}}. Don't fuss about that. Those were probably just wolves."

And he kept walking. Lady Willsbourgh looked at {{playerName}}. "Is that better?"
