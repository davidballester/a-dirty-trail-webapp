Something was off there, and {{playerName}} was sure of it. But her willpower had never been that great, and after everything that had happened to them during the day, the food in front of her was more that she could handle.

The fillet was tender and juicy, and it tasted of butter and wood. The thing in the cup was some kind of liquor. She didn't know much about those kinds of drinks, or so she told her mother, but she was quite sure it was something that the girl had distilled herself. It was strong and warm and it revived her.

The girl just stood there, by the fire, watching them eat and drink in silence.
