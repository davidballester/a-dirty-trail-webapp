The dawn found them on the other side of the blockade, returning the same way they had been going that afternoon.

"At least it's not raining anymore," said {{playerName}}. "What about singing something?"

"A hymn, maybe?" said Lady Willsbourgh.

"Oh, please, no," grunted the minister. "I hate those."

"I just realized you'll be late for your wedding, Lady Willsbourgh!" said {{playerName}}.

"It'll give me time to fix my hair properly," she said. "Imagine going down the aisle with this thing. It would have been a disaster!"

"Just imagine!" shouted the minister, and laughed for a while.

"I know just the song," said the minister.

"Great! What is it?"

"It's called 'All the pain and suffering'. I think you'll love it."

"Hard pass."

"A hymn, maybe?" said Lady Willsbourgh, then gasped. "That reminds me of the poor minister," she added, and started sobbing.

"That kind of killed the mood."

On their way, they passed the stagecoach, then the dead driver. They kept going.

Right before sunset, they arrived at a town, the same one from which they had got into the stagecoach the day before.

The people on the street stopped in their tracks to look at them.

"Oh, do I have something on my face?" asked Lady Willsbourgh, turning to {{playerName}} and the minister.

"Mud," said the minister. "And blood."

"Lack of insight," added {{playerName}}.

"I'm in dire need of a bath," said Lady Willsbourgh, and pointed to the town's hotel. "I'll be checking in. See you soon!"

The minister tried his flask for the twentieth time that day, only to find that no liquor had magically appeared in it.

"I'll go to refill this," said he. And started walking towards a tavern.

"Then it's time for me to find a good spot and collapse for a couple of days," said {{playerName}}.

And so she did. For once, something that had started well, ended well.

"They must be wondering what is wrong with us," said the minister, and chuckled. "Oh, if they knew."

"About your alcoholism and lack of faith?" asked {{playerName}}, and the minister looked her in the eye, dead serious.

"I meant the people in the woods. And that huge thing."

"Oh, that."

"Yeah." The minister tried his flask for the twentieth time that day, only to find that no liquor had magically appeared in it.

"I'll go to refill this," said he. And started walking towards a tavern. "Then we'll have to talk to the sheriff. And arrange a proper burial for Lady Willsbourgh."

"Sure thing," said {{playerName}}. She went to the hotel, rented a room and collapsed on the bed, without even taking a bath. There would be time later on for that sort of thing. And maybe some much-needed introspection.

But before departing, she stopped and looked at {{playerName}} with a grave expression.

"We need to talk to the sheriff."

"I'm not turning myself in!" shouted {{playerName}}.

"I meant about those people in the woods. About the minister," said Lady Willsbourgh.

"Oh, it's fine then. Sure, we'll do that."

"But a bath first."

"Maybe two," said {{playerName}}.
