For some reason, {{playerName}} expected the old lady to vanish into the air, but she didn't. Her corpse lied there, tore open, her teeth bare.

"I'm sorry," {{playerName}} said softly, and looked at the necklace, still tied around her wrist. There was something about it. Something she couldn't tell. But, somehow, it felt right not get rid of it.

"Is it cursed?" she whispered, and a shudder came over her. She looked at the old lady one last time before departing.
