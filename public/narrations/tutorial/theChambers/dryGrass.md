The pile of dry grass was just what it looked like, and it smelled like the kitchen of aunt Holly in winter.

"Why are you putting dry leaves in the stew, aunt Holly," {{playerName}} would ask.

"Oh, so if you put it in a mug and pour hot water in it, that's fine, but the second you put it in a pot, you're just poor and it would be best to start begging in front the church." She would go on and on for an hour, and the stew would burn by then, making the lunchtime even more miserable.

"Those were the days," sighed {{playerName}}.

Back to the pile of dry grass, {{playerName}} thought it was for the strange ornaments that were hung at the entrance of the tower.

Almost buried by the grass, she found a sharp blade that had been used for trimming the grass. She took it.
