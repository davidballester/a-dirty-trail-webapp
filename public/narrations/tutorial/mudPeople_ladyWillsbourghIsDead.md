The minister said a prayer that, in all honesty, sounded like mumbling. By now, he had sobered up, and {{playerName}} found that she disliked him now. It could be the constant massaging of the temples, or his dry voice. Or maybe the fact that he kept muttering, "All your fault".

"Where to now?" {{playerName}} dared to ask.

"They told about a place on the other side of that thing," said the minister, pointing at the blockade. "That is, before you slaughtered them."

"A place as good as any other, I say," said {{playerName}}, trying to cheer things up, but the rain intensified, as if to deny its sympathy.
