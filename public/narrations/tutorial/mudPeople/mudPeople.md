"Where are your horses?" asked one of the figures, who to {{playerName}}'s keen eye, started to look as an old woman.

"I told you before," said Lady Willsbourgh. "Our horses have escaped."

"Give us your stuff, then," said a one-eyed man. Or maybe it was that the mud covered his eye. Nope, it was missing, {{playerName}} was now sure of it. "Food and whiskey."

"That was rather specific," {{playerName}} said. "Who the hell are you, though?"

"It doesn't matter," said the old woman. {{playerName}} looked at them all, covered in mud, from boots to hair.

"Well, I'll call you mud people, then."

"How does she know?" they all shouted.
