"Listen here, good folks," the minister said. "We don't have anything for you, as you can see. And we are in dire need of refuge."

"We have nothing to offer you, strangers," the one-eyed man said.

"Only advice," said the old woman. "Do not venture forward."

"That's not helpful," said {{playerName}}

"There is no refuge for you out here," said the old woman. "Only despair."

"That we have noticed," said {{playerName}}. "Anything more specific?"

"The covenant will hunt you down if you dare cross this frontier," said the old woman.

"I don't see a reason why," said Lady Willsbourgh. "We are but travelers looking for lodging to spend the night!"

"If you're lucky, they might bury your remains," said the one-eyed man. "How's that for lodging?" And he laughed, but so did the minister, which ruined it for him.

"Tell her," the woman said to the one-eyed man.

"Why?" he responded.

"Just do it," said the woman, and the man sighed.

"Find my boots," he said. {{playerName}} looked at him, puzzled.

"I don't think they'll fit, mate."

"Look inside," he said. "You'll find a key. It opens a box in the cellar that I hid behind an old rug. You'll need what's inside."

"A treasure hunt!" said {{playerName}}. "I love it already! Despite the creepiness, that is."

"Cross at your own risk, but think that the ones you encountered down the road were the lucky ones," said the woman.

And with this, they departed.

The minister, Lady Willsbourgh, and {{playerName}} were now alone again, and they looked at each other.

"That could have gone worse, I guess," {{playerName}} said.

"Well, let's just say they haven't filled me with optimism as to what we'll find farther ahead," Lady Willsbourgh said.

"If it has a roof, it's fine for me," the minister said. "And if they had something to drink, all the better!"

"Tell me, dear," Lady Wilsbourgh said, looking at {{playerName}}. "Have you found a way across the blockade?"
