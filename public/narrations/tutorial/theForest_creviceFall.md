{{playerName}} tried to lower herself onto the crevice, and soon found that the slight drizzle that had been falling for some time now had made the mud slippery. No matter how hard she tried to claw herself to the ground, she found herself sliding faster and faster.

Then she lost the ground under herself.

And floated for a split of a second.

Then hit the bottom as hard as that minister hit the flask.
