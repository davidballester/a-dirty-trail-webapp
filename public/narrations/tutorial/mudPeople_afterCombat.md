The smoke cleared and now there were muddy bodies on the muddy road. But not all of them were muddy.

Lady Willsbourgh lied on the ground, hardly breathing, if at all. The second stray bullet to hit her that day would be the last one.

"Oh, you poor creature," the minister said, kneeling beside her and cradling her arm. {{playerName}} went to her, and the minister gave her a look, and it was harsh.

"Not even God will forgive what you just did," he said. "Or maybe he will if you became Catholic and invite the Pope to a fancy restaurant. I don't know! What I _do_ know is that this is your fault."

And Lady Willsbourgh died.
