Outside it was chilly. Maybe because of how windy it was, or because the woods among which the road laid looked straight out of a ghost story. Or maybe because of the dead driver collapsed on the ground and the two thugs approaching the stagecoach with rifles in their hands.

"Who's you?" asked one of them, the ugliest of them both, or so {{playerName}} thought.

"Who's who?" she answered, trying to gain some time for no particular reason.

"Gimme all your stuff, ma'am," the other one said, the not-so ugly and apparently good-mannered armed robber.

By now, {{playerName}} had started to come to terms with what had to be done. In her hands, the revolver felt heavy and greasy, just like the minister looked, now gazing from the other side of the windows as he gulped his liquor.

"Gimme!" the ugly one shouted, and {{playerName}} decided the minister was right, and that it was high time to earn her worth.
