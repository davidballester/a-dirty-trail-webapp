The horses stopped suddenly and something fell from the driver's seat, groaning. Maybe a sack of potatoes, {{playerName}} thought.

"Who's shouting?" Lady Willsbourgh asked frantically.

"Not the sheriff, I'll tell you that much," the minister said. From under his seat, he got a box, and from it, a revolver he immediately handed to {{playerName}}.

"What do I want that for?" she asked, raising her eyebrows.

"I thought it matched your eyes! What do you imagine?"

"Oh, no. You take it," said {{playerName}}.

"{{playerName}} is right, you know?" Lady Willsbourgh said. {{#if-has-flag ladyCartwright}}"It's not a lady's duty to handle this kind of thing."{{else}}"It's a man's job!"{{/if-has-flag}}

"That's not what I meant," said {{playerName}}, raising an eyebrow.

"Anyway, I'm no good with this," protested the minister. "It was but ten minutes ago that I realized there were two of you in the stagecoach with me. I could not hit a barn right now."

{{playerName}} realized it was true and was about to look for Lady Willsbourgh's help, but the smoking hole in her hair spoke volumes of how ridiculous that would be, so she took the revolver.

{{#if-has-flag "alys"}}"Now, now, my dear,"{{else}}"Now, now, milady,"{{/if-has-flag}} the minister said, opening the car's door and inviting {{playerName}} gently, but firmly, to step outside. "Time to earn your worth."
