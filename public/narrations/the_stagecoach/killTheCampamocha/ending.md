A week later, {{playerName}} sat on the second row at the church where the minister officiated the wedding between Lady Willsbourgh and Mr. Scoundrel. That was not his name of course, but it was how the minister and {{playerName}} had started to call him after meeting him.

{{playerName}} had lost a couple of toes as a result of her voyage. When I said it was cold, it's because it _was_ cold, you see, and the toes had frozen and become purple by the time they had reached their destination.

After that, Lady Willsbourgh stayed in the town and the minister and {{playerName}} departed, but in different directions. They told nobody about what had happened, but they weren't quite sure why.

{{playerName}} lived to do some more shooting in the years coming, but that is a different story, and I'm not in the mood right now, so we'll heave it here.

A week later, {{playerName}} waited in a cell for the sheriff and a posse of locals, led by the minister, to recover Lady Willsbourgh and the driver's bodies and bring them back, and luckily, to find the people who lurked the woods and killed foreigners.

Of course, nobody believed the story about the Campamocha, no matter how loud {{playerName}} screamed it. She later came to realize that may not have been the best strategy to be taken seriously.

The posse came back with no bodies but a couple of fashionable and muddy hats.

"It's all that's left," the minister said to {{playerName}}, still behind bars.

The sheriff let {{playerName}} out, and she happily followed his advice to leave town at once.

She never came back and never again spoke of the Campamocha, except when drunk and trying to impress some guy, but those are different adventures that came later and I'm not in the mood to keep on narrating.

A week later, Lady Willsbourgh married Mr. Scoundrel, as {{playerName}} referred to the groom internally and just once to his face. The bride was a bit low on energy, and sometimes spoke to {{playerName}} about the minister.

"Did that thing really exist?" asked Lady Willsbourgh to {{playerName}} once after having had no less than three cups of tea.

"Do you think I'd made up something like that? It was a cult! In the forest! And their god was a big thing that lurked in the woods eating people! Well, it sounds made up when I put it like that, but it happened! It was real!"

Lady Willsbourgh was never quite sure about it, but she never told anyone about the incident, and {{playerName}} didn't either.

She left a few days after the wedding, and never came back. She also stopped talking about the Campamocha, except when drunk and trying to impress some guy, but those are different adventures that came later and I'm not in the mood to keep on narrating.
