"Is she really your mother?" asked {{playerName}}. "You don't look alike."

"It's a manner of speaking," said the guy.

"But is she?"

"The wheel of fate," whispered the old woman.

"Are you sure, mama?" asked the skinny guy.

"Sure about what?" asked {{playerName}}. "What is going on?"

The old woman nodded, and then the bearded guy shot her right in the chest.

"There goes my advantage," said {{playerName}}, getting up.

"This is all your fault!" yelled the sinny guy, charging at {{playerName}} with an axe.
