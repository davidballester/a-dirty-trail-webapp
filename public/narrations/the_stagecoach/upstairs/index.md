"Oh, what the...?" {{playerName}} shouted when she saw two faces staring at her. They belonged to a woman, who seemed older than the forest itself, and a man, covered in scars.

"You're a nosy little mouse, ain't ya?" said the man, and the woman chuckled. They were both sitting by a small fire in the middle of the room, both covered with blankets. They would have looked like a nice old couple, but they didn't. "They look like aunt Victoria and uncle Bob," thought {{playerName}}, remembering how they'd rock back and forth on the living room of their cabin in complete darkness just to fall asleep. "Creepy as hell."
