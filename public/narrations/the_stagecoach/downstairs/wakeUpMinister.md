The minister was fast asleep. It might have been the liquor that girl served them for supper, but {{playerName}} had a hunch the minister slept like that every other day. For a second, she even thought he might be dead. And the smell didn't help either, but at some point, he farted. Just a little, nothing too gross.

"Come on, minister," {{playerName}} said, shaking him, but it was no use.
