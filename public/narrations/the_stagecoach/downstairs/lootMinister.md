The minister didn't have much with him, all he had was in his pockets. And he had not got naked to sleep, it was too cold for that, so {{playerName}} went through his pockets, quite confident he would not wake up.

He had his pipe and some tobacco, but aunt Leticia had taught {{playerName}} that the only decent form of poison one should consume is prayer, and the minister didn't have anything like that with him, surprisingly. He had his flask, though, almost empty.

"Cheers," said {{playerName}}, emptying it, for she had never paid too much attention to aunt Leticia's morale teachings.
