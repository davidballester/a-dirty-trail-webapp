The girl laughed.

"Do I look like a cannibal?" she asked.

"Well, I've never seen one, so how could I know?"

"It's deer," the girl said

"Dear to you, you mean? Is it the meat of someone you knew?"

"Deer, the animal," the girl said, unamused. Then, she served a dark liquid from a jar into the cups.

"Come, sit. This is for you."
