They gathered in a clearing, and in the middle, they laid down the minister and Lady Willsbourgh, who were barely awake.

"That liquor was strong," said {{playerName}}, and Kolyn nodded.

"I'll teach you how to brew them."

"That's probably going to be the only good thing about this whole arrangement," said {{playerName}} to herself.

Then, it appeared. And it was massive.

"The Campamocha," said Kolyn, and all of them kneeled in front of it.

The thing looked as if it was made of giant leaves. Its head was triangular, and had the size of a bull's. It walked on four legs, and it had two arms folded on themselves.
