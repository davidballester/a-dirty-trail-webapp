Needless to say, the minister couldn't control the horses, and sooner than later, the stagecoach fell out of the road, lost a wheel, and broke its axis. The horses were lucky. The reins snapped and they run away, to live a happy life in the wilderness, or so {{playerName}} thought.

"You said you knew what you were doing, minister," complained Lady Willsbourgh, getting out of the stagecoach and trying to fix her hat so her ruined hair would stay covered.

"Do you remember me saying that?" the minister asked. He had fallen from his seat, but that hadn't sobered him up.

{{playerName}} looked around. The landscape was majestic. The forests climbed up the hills and a thick fog rolled down from the heights, engulfing them. Quite beautiful, but a scene one would rather like on a picture, not in front of them, for it appeared to whisper to one's ear: hypothermia is coming.

"How far off is the town?" asked {{playerName}}.

"A day and a half, at least," the minister said.

"We'll never make it!" cried Lady Willsbourgh. "And all because of you!"

"I kind of remember some guys shooting our driver," the minister laughed. "But sure, because of me. Anyway, we were supposed to get to a refuge farther ahead before sunset."

"Then, let's get going," {{playerName}} said, and she took her suitcase. But of course, Lady Willsbourgh had like a million things, and she wouldn't let go any of them.

"That hat is from Paris," she'd say. Or "That contains medicine for my heart." All nonsense like that.

After a while, everything was settled. The minister carried himself, which was quite a burden on its own, and Lady Willsbourgh had somehow managed to carry a couple of suitcases and three boxes.
