_Survival check succeeded_

{{playerName}} had never been one of those that climb trees for fun, yet her fingers found the spaces between the logs, and her feet pushed her up. Before she knew how, she had reached the top, and she sat down there.

"What can you see, dear?" asked Lady Willsbourgh.

That was a good question, for there was not much to see.

"Just the road ahead," she said.

"Is that it?" asked the minister. {{#if-has-flag "demonsInTheWoods"}}"No evil demons on the other side?"{{/if-has-flag}}

"Nothing at all," she grunted.

"Well, we need to get to the other side," said the minister.

"Not climbing that thing, surely!" said Lady Willsbourgh.

"By no means I'd ask such a thing from you, milady!" the minister said, and chuckled. "You could lose a glove!"

"We'll have to find a way around it," said {{playerName}}. She climbed back down.

"I'll look for one."
