She walked among the trees and bushes and rocks. The air was damp, and she was colder than ever. All she could think of were warm baskets of kittens in front of a roaring fire. And a pot over the fire, with a nice stew boiling in it. Some meat, onions, carrots... Now, she felt hungry too.

The blockade was nowhere to be seen. Or the road. Not even the crevice. What she saw, though, was a shadow, not far away, among the trees.

"You have to be kidding me," she said, for demons was not on her list of things she would want to encounter.

She started to walk quickly, and so did the shadow. Now it felt more present. She could even hear it grunting, going through the bushes and breaking branches under its hoofs.

"Just go away!" she shouted, but that only enrages the thing even more, and it charged through the thicket towards her. Her heart skipped a bit as she tried to grab the revolver.

The thing was coming towards her, and just before it arrived, she saw that it was a boar. Not that knowing that made the fear of getting killed by one any less alarming.
